# Summary

We love to make home pasta. It's really good dish and when friends are coming - we can cook it all together and have fun. But it was always hard to find a place to put and dry it a bit, so Iâ€™ve decided to design and 3d-print pasta dryer. It's well suited for tagliatelle or lasagna

You need to print:
- **6x** ray
- **1x** base
- **1x** stick
- **1x** shelf mount

It's easily folded and will not consume a lot of space on your kitchen

**Note:** If you want to print one, but don't have a kitchen shelf to mount, I can prepare a special version - which you can put on top of wine bottle and put on the table. Just ask in comments!

# Print Settings

Printer: Rebel II
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .2
Infill: Doesn't matter - 20% is generally ok

Notes: 
I would not recommend to print 'rays' with ABS, because it's considered to be not-food safe.
Mine drier is printed from PLA, except of base part - which is printed from ABS, to be a bit more flexible (in general PLA or PETG should also work)
Please always check that material that you use is food safe.

# Post-Printing

## Remove supports

You shouldn't turn on support generation in your slicer, because all necessary support constructions are already included to this model.

Just remove extra material from top of base (where extender stick is mounted) and from shelf mount. 

Then click together all parts!
